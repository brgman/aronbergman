# ❤️ Migration

**VS Code → IntelliJ / CLion** for smarter, controlled development 🚀  
  - [CLion official site](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/)  
  - [GitLab official site](https://about.gitlab.com/)

I’m moving all my development to **GitLab**, and here’s why:

## 1. Aggressive AI Marketing on GitHub
GitHub Copilot is a strategic Microsoft product, and its marketing is designed to push developers into using it. Many users feel that GitHub “forces” AI features even when they are unwanted.

### How it shows:
- **Default integration:** Copilot is built directly into GitHub and VS Code; disabling it isn’t always obvious.  
- **Persistent notifications:** Constant banners, tips, and prompts encourage you to enable Copilot, even if you already tried or don’t want it.  
- **AI-first focus:** Microsoft promotes Copilot as a “must-have developer tool,” making the marketing intentionally persistent.  
- **Subscription model:** As a paid service, GitHub tries to convert free users into paying subscribers.

## 2. Security & Privacy
- Hosting on my own servers gives complete control over my code and stronger cybersecurity.  
- Unlike GitHub, where many developers have complained about heavy use of public code for AI training, GitLab offers more privacy options.

## 3. Better Control & Features
- More control over projects  
- Built-in CI/CD for seamless automation  
- Less intrusive AI marketing 😅
