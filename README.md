# Moving from GitHub to GitLab

Why I moved

## 1. European & Local Choice

I prefer using **IntelliJ / CLion** because JetBrains is a European company 🇪🇺.  
Supporting European software helps our local economy and aligns with living in the EU.
**VS Code → IntelliJ / CLion** for smarter, controlled development 🚀  
  - [CLion official site](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/)

## 2. Aggressive AI Marketing on GitHub
GitHub Copilot is a strategic Microsoft product, and its marketing is designed to push developers into using it. Many users feel that GitHub “forces” AI features even when they are unwanted.

### How it shows:
- **Default integration:** Copilot is built directly into GitHub and VS Code; disabling it isn’t always obvious.  
- **Persistent notifications:** Constant banners, tips, and prompts encourage you to enable Copilot, even if you already tried or don’t want it.  
- **AI-first focus:** Microsoft promotes Copilot as a “must-have developer tool,” making the marketing intentionally persistent.  
- **Subscription model:** As a paid service, GitHub tries to convert free users into paying subscribers.

## 3. Security & Privacy
- Hosting on my own servers gives complete control over my code and stronger cybersecurity.

## 4. Better Control & Features
- More control over projects  
- Built-in CI/CD for seamless automation  
- Less intrusive AI marketing 😅
